The gallery module, written in angularjs.

![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/origal/gallery/master/gallery_cover.png)

I've included 2 examples: index.html and alternative_index.html that you can try, which demonstrate the gallery module capabilities.

If an image is missing and gives us a 304/404, We make up for it with a nice android logo as a fallback.

Have fun :)
